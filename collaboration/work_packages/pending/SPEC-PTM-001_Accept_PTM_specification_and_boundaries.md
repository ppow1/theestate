# SPEC-PTM-001 — Accept PTM specification and boundaries

## Status
Pending

## Owner
Chief Architect

## Execution lane
Codex

## Campaign and launch group
- Campaign ID: `PTM-00`
- Launch group: `G00`
- Campaign instruction: `collaboration/work_packages/campaigns/ptm/PTM-00_Governance_Acceptance.md`
- Integration checkpoint: Gate 0 — authority acceptance

## Objective
Review and accept the canonical PTM specification boundaries without implementation.

## Accepted authority baseline
This package is promoted from `collaboration/work_packages/planning/ptm_drafts/SPEC-PTM-001_accept_ptm_specification_and_boundaries.md` under the Steward / Chief Architect acceptance recorded in `docs/architecture/estate_ptm_specification_acceptance.md`. The accepted baseline includes WP-0658, WP-0660, and WP-0661. Codex-only routing is mandatory for this cycle; do not use the local RTX 4090 worker.

## Exact repository scope
docs/architecture/estate_project_task_management_*.md; collaboration/work_packages/planning/*

## Required inputs
- `docs/architecture/estate_ptm_specification_acceptance.md`
- `docs/architecture/estate_ptm_parallel_campaign_execution_plan.md`
- `docs/architecture/estate_ptm_dependency_and_parallelism_plan.md`
- `collaboration/work_packages/planning/estate_ptm_package_manifest.json`
- `collaboration/work_packages/planning/estate_ptm_campaign_manifest.json`
- `collaboration/work_packages/planning/estate_ptm_dependency_manifest.json`
- Source planning draft: `collaboration/work_packages/planning/ptm_drafts/SPEC-PTM-001_accept_ptm_specification_and_boundaries.md`
- collaboration/work_packages/planning/estate_project_task_management_work_package_backlog.md
- collaboration/reports/project_management/WP-0659_execution_lane_parallelism_and_timeline_scenarios.md
- collaboration/work_packages/pending/WP-0660_Correct_PTM_Execution_Decomposition_and_Hour_Scale_Timeline_Model.md

## Bounded implementation deliverables
- One bounded implementation-ready specification or validation artifact for this slice.
- Evidence notes sufficient to promote a future Pending package.
- No production PTM code is authorized by this draft.

## Explicit non-goals and authority boundaries
- Do not perform work outside this package scope or broaden it into a replacement PTM program.
- Do not create a second dispatch queue, second registry, second scheduler, or new governance authority.
- Do not independently alter frozen upstream contracts; open a stop/replan note if a contract change is required.
- Do not merge the pull request unless a separate accepted workflow explicitly authorizes merge.

## Dependencies and readiness gates
- Package dependencies: Accepted authority gate only.
- Dependencies accepted or explicitly waived by Chief Architect.
- Current branch rebased and package revalidated against latest manifests.
- No collision with another active package touching the same future contract surface.

## Parallel-safety classification
Serial root gate; primary parallel group G00.

## Shared-file and shared-schema collision controls
Low while this remains a planning draft. Future promotion must check collisions for docs/architecture/estate_project_task_management_*.md; collaboration/work_packages/planning/*.
- Shared contracts may not be independently changed by downstream branches after their freeze gate.
- If this package touches a manifest, coordinate through the campaign integration checkpoint to avoid divergent campaign membership.

## Branch and integration expectations
- Branch name guidance: `codex/spec-ptm-001-accept_ptm_specification_and_boundaries`.
- Keep commits atomic to this package and include evidence updates in the same branch.
- Open a pull request for Chief Architect review and do not merge it.
- Merge only through the campaign checkpoint order in `docs/architecture/estate_ptm_parallel_campaign_execution_plan.md`.

## Required validation commands and evidence
- `git diff --check`
- Run package-specific tests or documentation validation for any touched executable files.
- Capture validation evidence in `collaboration/work_packages/completions/SPEC-PTM-001_completion_receipt.md`.
- Review changed files with `git diff --check`.
- Run package-specific unit or documentation validation after promotion.

## Acceptance criteria
- Deliverables are complete and source-backed.
- No second queue, second registry, or governance authority is introduced.
- Estimates remain at or below 60 active minutes or document an evidence-based exception.

## Required completion receipt path
`collaboration/work_packages/completions/SPEC-PTM-001_completion_receipt.md`

## Delivery requirement
Open a pull request for Chief Architect review after committing this package. Do not merge it.
